# Project Description

In my quest to enhance my skills in responsive design, I decided to transform all my previous exercises into responsive designs, and this project is one of them.

The project includes a container named 'container,' which houses a two containers and a grid container (row). Within this row, there is a single column. The column contains a card with background-image, image and text. While the remaining two containers consists background-colors.

The font-family used is 'Kumbh Sans', sans-serif,' with a font size of 18px and font weights of 700, 400.

Some CSS attributes provided were not documented in Bootstrap. However, I utilized custom CSS to tailor them, and I employed certain Bootstrap features to control their behavior. To adapt the knowledge I learnt about Code simplicity and re-userbility.

The expected outcome of the project can be found in the images folder.
